# FunNums
******Intro******

Do you remember having to learn math by memorization of flash cards? 
The dry, unappealing process bores kids; I know I couldn't look at those 
cards for longer than ten minutes! The idea behind FunNums is to give 
kids an interactive and fun way to learn elementary math in the form of 
engaging minigames.  FunNums provides minigames for arithmetic, fractions, 
and inequalities, and more! Each game is designed to both test a player's 
knowledge of a subject and teach by rewarding correct actions. The high score 
board will encourage competitive kids to hone their math skills to top the
rankings or set a new personal best. The immersive minigames may be so much
fun that a player may not even notice that they are learning, only that they 
are crushing their old high score!

******Installing and Running******

To play FunNums, you need to install AndroidStudio 3. 
Then, you can open this project from Android Studio and press "Run" 
to play this game on a connected Android Phone or an emulator 
(The game performs and feels better on actual phones!)

When using a real phone, make sure USB debugging is enabled. 
Here is a link describing how to do this for different Android versions.
